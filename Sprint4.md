# Work completed in Sprint 4
## Frontend
- Created two games: a matching game and a math game
	- Matching game: Has a timer, has matching cards, has a winning condition, saves lowest time and current time, can replay the game
	- Math Game: Has a countdown, keeps a score, and shows wrong answers and changes questions when the right answers
- Linked frontEnd to backEnd for signUp page to create new users
