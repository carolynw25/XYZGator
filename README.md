# Project Description
In XYZGator, we provide a user interface that gives children (ages 5+) the resources they need to develop stronger analytical, problem-solving, and intellectual skills. Through memory-matching, grammar exercises, basic math exercises, and other learning applications, XYZGator provides a fun and rich learning experience that allows them to get ahead of the learning curve and have a stronger foundational basis for their future education and life skills.
