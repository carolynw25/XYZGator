            I will be the leader of a company that ends up being worth billions of dollars, because I got the answers. I understand culture. I am the nucleus. I think thatâ€™s a responsibility that I have, to push possibilities, to show people, this is the level that things could be at.

             experience that helps children get ahead of the learning curve and build a stronger foundational basis for 
             their future education and life skills. Our commitment is to create a safe, inclusive, and supportive 
             environment that fosters lifelong learning and personal growth for all children.          </p>
