# Detail work you've completed in Sprint 3
## Frontend
## Backend
- Created function to get the user's ID when needed
- Updated signup function so that the password is hashed - this provides more security for the user's information
- Created functionality to receive and store the the time taken to complete the memory game, and then store the record/best time (lowest time)
- Modified function for updating users - now includes separate functionality for updating each piece of the user's information (usage will become more apparent when frontend adds a profile/settings page showing current user information)
- IN PROGRESS: Creating functionality for the 'forgot password' feature - involves sending a password reset link via email so that users can reset the password themselves
## Together
- Connected FrontEnd and Backend for User Signup (Now have a working login and signup)
